# Explore-Weather-Trends
- In this repository, I analyzed local(i.e. My City's Temperature) and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
- I used the moving average to find variations in temperature over years and then used a line chart to comapre the temperature trends over years.
